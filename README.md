# Moon Animator 2
this is just a simple crack for Moon Animator 2, it likely won't be updated very often.

if anyone wants to crack it themself, just search "Invalid" and remove the chunk of code after the whitespace. (it's on line 13 iirc.)

# Updates
if i haven't updated the module, you can go into `init` and change _g.ver to whatever the NEW ... says.

take the current version (the number after 'NEW')

and change _g.ver to whatever it says, then save as a local plugin.
